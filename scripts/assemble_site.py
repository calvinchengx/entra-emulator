"""Assemble the published site: the landing page at the root, the docs beneath it.

    scripts/assemble_site.py --out _site
    scripts/assemble_site.py --self-test

WHY THIS EXISTS. The docs moved from `/entra-emulator/<slug>/` to
`/entra-emulator/docs/<slug>/`, which is the shape the rest of the family uses.
That moved **61 published routes**, and a moved URL is a 404 for every link
already pointing at it: this project's own README, five sibling repositories,
and anything outside them nobody can enumerate.

So every old path gets a redirect stub here, and the stubs are not optional
politeness: `website/published-routes.txt` is the route list captured from the
build immediately BEFORE the move, and this script fails if any entry in it
would 404. That file is the oracle. Deriving the check from the new build
instead would only prove the new build agrees with itself.

ASTRO'S `redirects:` CANNOT DO THIS. A redirect key is emitted underneath the
configured base, so after the move `/00-quickstart/` publishes at
`/entra-emulator/docs/00-quickstart/` and nothing answers the root-level path
anyone actually linked to. The stubs must be written outside Astro, which is
here.

THE BADGES STAY AT THE ROOT. They are written into `_site/`, not `_site/docs/`,
so the endpoint URLs in README.md do not move at all.
